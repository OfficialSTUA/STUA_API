Started in the summer of 2019, the STUA has been trying to create some sort of display for the second floor TriBeCa bridge entrance. This display will display subway information and if possible, school club advertisements and other useful information. \n",

If you code anything interesting you would like to bring to our attention, you can ping Irvin, Abheek, or I (Ravindra). \n",
